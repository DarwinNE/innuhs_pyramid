This library is released by Tursi aka Mike Brent for TI-99/4A coding via GCC. It is released to the public domain with no restrictions (but credit would be nice if you use it). Likewise, I make no guarantees or promises!

Documentation is found in each of the .h files. The .h files are briefly described here:

grom.h   - helper definitions and functions for accessing GROM
kscan.h  - include file for using the console's kscan code (including joysticks)
player.h - include file for using my compressed VGM audio player
sound.h  - helper definitions for the sound chip and console sound interrupt player
vdp.h    - helper definitions and functions for the VDP and console interrupt
puff.h   - deflate implementation - from the zlib library and created by Mark Adler    madler@alumni.caltech.edu
conio.h  - console functions (including cprintf) for basic screen I/O
files.h  - dsrlnk and related functions and constants for native TI device IO.
math.h   - numeric functions (sqrt, abs)
string.h - string manipulation and conversion functions
system.h - halt and exit functions 

Note that the current version of puff has all error handling disabled, it just calls halt().
So test your streams before using it!
